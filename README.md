## Abstract
Code generation is a promising capability of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, enabling the generation of programming code from user comments. This research focuses on exploring the power of LLMs for generating data science (DS) workflow, with the goal of democratizing data science. However, generating DS workflows poses challenges due to the need for accurate code generation across various DS problems, involving considering both user feedback and data information to suggest the next task and accommodating diverse user intentions for each workflow. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach based on ChatGPT for DS workflow generation guided by user feedback. Our system leverages ChatGPT to comprehend the DS problem and underlying data, enabling correct code generation. By jointly encoding user feedback and data information, the system can correctly suggest the next task in the DS workflow. Our system also takes into account user intentions for precise workflow generation. We conduct a user usability test to evaluate our proposed system and compare it with the current capabilities of ChatGPT in generating DS tasks. The results demonstrate the efficacy and usefulness of the system in DS workflow generation. Moreover, to facilitate future research in this domain, we release the first corpus of DS workflow generation, encompassing diverse DS datasets and problems.
