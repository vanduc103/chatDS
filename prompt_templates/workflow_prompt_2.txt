Workflow type: visualization-focused

Workflow generation:
"creates new columns from the 'date' column in the dataframe, including year, quarter, half, month_name, and day_of_week, and displays the first five rows of the dataframe.",
'create the graph to shows the number of cases by year.',
'creates a bar chart to visualize the number of cases by quarter.',
'create the graph to shows the number of cases by half of year.',
'plot the graph shows the number of cases by month name.',
'plot the graph shows the number of cases by day of week.',
'plots the number of cases by location using plotly express.',
'plot the bar chart shows the number of cases by location.',
'plot barchart to shows the number of cases by type.',
